# Tobias Dahlberg 

Currently trying to explore the world of developing. 

Hello, at the moment I am enrolled in a two year webdevelopment-program at <a href="https://www.miun.se">Mittuniversitetet</a> in Sweden. 

Amongst a lot of things we will learn scripts and languages like:

* HTML 
* CSS
* JavaScript 
* Node 
* PHP 
* C# 
* ASP 
* .NET. 

You can read more about the program here (in Swedish): <a href="https://www.miun.se/webbutveckling">Webbutvecklingsprogrammet</a>

## About me 

To get a hold of me try <toda2100@student.miun.se>

Normally lives in Sweden (in Jönköping) and work as a business developer at a large Energy utility. However right now living in the south of Germany because of some other family members working here for some years. 
But that gives some time for the kids, cycling and skiing in between web-projects and other projects. 

Soon I will start uploading some projects here as well! 

Best regards
Tobias
